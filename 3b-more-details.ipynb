By far, the most common problem is having fastai installed for a different environment/different Python installation than the one your Jupyter notebook is using (you can have Python installed in multiple places on your computer and not even realize it!). Or, you might have different versions of fastai installed in your different environments/different Python installations (and the one you are running in Jupyter notebook could be out of date, even if you installed version 1.0 somewhere else). For both of these problems, please [see this entry](https://docs.fast.ai/troubleshoot.html#modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-fastaivision)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"41bd8d03-8ca8-4ec8-b81b-7ec7728af65e"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## More detail about randomized SVD"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"5aee1b31-174d-40b4-aede-2dcdc5482953"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["I didn't cover how randomized SVD worked, because we aren't going to learn about it in detail in this course.  The main things I want you to know about randomized SVD are:\n- **it is fast**\n- **it gives us a truncated SVD** (whereas with traditional SVD, we are usually throwing away small singular values and their corresponding columns)\n\nIf you were curious to know more, two keys are:\n- It is often useful to be able to reduce dimensionality of data in a way that preserves distances. The Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma is a classic result of this type.  [Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma): a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved (proof uses random projections).\n- We haven't found a better general SVD method, we'll just use the method we have on a smaller matrix.  \n\nBelow is an over-simplified version of `randomized_svd` (you wouldn't want to use this in practice, but it covers the core ideas).  The main part to notice is that we multiply our original matrix by a smaller random matrix (`M @ rand_matrix`) to produce `smaller_matrix`, and then use our same `np.linalg.svd` as before:\n\n```\ndef randomized_svd(M, k=10):\n    m, n = M.shape\n    transpose = False\n    if m < n:\n        transpose = True\n        M = M.T\n        \n    rand_matrix = np.random.normal(size=(M.shape[1], k))  # short side by k\n    Q, _ = np.linalg.qr(M @ rand_matrix, mode='reduced')  # long side by k\n    smaller_matrix = Q.T @ M                              # k by short side\n    U_hat, s, V = np.linalg.svd(smaller_matrix, full_matrices=False)\n    U = Q @ U_hat\n    \n    if transpose:\n        return V.T, s.T, U.T\n    else:\n        return U, s, V\n```\n\nThis code snippet is from this [randomized-SVD jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fastai/randomized-SVD/blob/master/Randomized%20SVD.ipynb) which was the demo I used for my PyBay talk on [Using randomness to make code much faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i6kBz1kZ-A&list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&index=7)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"17aec9c0-9264-46cd-8471-fba563c92083"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Bayes Theorem"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1cd6f4c8-761b-4717-81e3-a35cded53549"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ex: Physicist Leonard Mlodinow tested positive for HIV in 1989.  \n\tHis doctor said there was a 99.9% chance he had HIV.  \n   \nA = positive test results\t\t\nB = having HIV\n\n\nTrue positives: \t$P(A|B) = 99.9\\%$\t\n\nPrevalence:\t$P(B)= 0.01\\%$\n\nFalse positives:\t$P(A|B^C) = 0.1\\%$\t\n\nWas his doctor correct?"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"06be550c-f31c-457e-9eb5-156ee8bdd58a"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This example is from the book:\n\n<img src=\"images/drunkards-walk.jpg\" alt=\"drunkard's walk\" style=\"width: 30%\"/>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"970e8f2a-d84e-4251-ade2-c47d39f0897b"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Bayes Theorem (for conditional probabilities): $$ P(A | B) P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) $$"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"13ca9712-1d33-4fcf-b11b-693be828cec2"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Answer"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f51a9916-7d1b-400a-9a46-a0ccd7e69119"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Exercise\n\n<img src=\"images/mlodinow-false-pos.png\" alt=\"Mlodinow\" style=\"width: 80%\"/>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"59960bfe-3ac7-4a64-b8a9-013d62266895"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"type":"ipynbError","data":"  File \"<ipython-input-19-c59e5f13894a>\", line 3\n    <img src=\"images/mlodinow-false-pos.png\" alt=\"Mlodinow\" style=\"width: 80%\"/>\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n","errorSummary":"<span class='ansi-red-fg'>SyntaxError</span>: invalid syntax (&lt;ipython-input-19-c59e5f13894a&gt;, line 3)","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n  File \"<ipython-input-19-c59e5f13894a>\", line 3\n    <img src=\"images/mlodinow-false-pos.png\" alt=\"Mlodinow\" style=\"width: 80%\"/>\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Derivation of Naive Bayes"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"fdc31fd8-69eb-4f26-b7eb-147dc64721ab"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We want to calculate the probability that the review \"I loved it\" is positive.
